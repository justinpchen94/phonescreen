# Explain the HTML DOM and its relevance to JavaScript

The Document Object Model allows JavaScript to obtain information about a page and manipulate it by adding or removing HTML elements, or by altering their attributes.  The DOM can be viewed as a programming interface for HTML, whereby you can access and alter its structure, attributes, styles, and events. According to Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), “The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.”
