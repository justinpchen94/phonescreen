# What is "closure" in JavaScript?

A closure is an inner function that has access to the variables in the outer (enclosing) function’s scope chain. The closure has access to variables in three scopes; specifically:
 
1. variable in its own scope
2. variables in the enclosing function’s scope
3. global variables.
